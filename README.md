# Sudo Labs Website (Version 2)
This is the second version of our website.

## Viewing and modifying the site locally
If you're interested in running the website locally here are the steps to follow:

1) Clone the repository
You can do this by typing the command `git clone https://github.com/sudo-labs/sudolabs_v2.git` in your terminal.

2) Install project dependencies
To install the project dependencies, go to your terminal, navigate to the project folder and run `npm install`.

3) Run gulp
[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) is the automation toolkit we use to compile our CSS from [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). The reason to run gulp, it that it will watch for any chances to the SASS files and it when then automatically compile the CSS to be used on the website.

4) Open index.html in your browser

Note: Steps 2) and 3) are only required if you want to make modifications to the project files. If you simply want to view the website locally, follow steps 1) and 4).
